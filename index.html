            <p> My name is Alexander, and this is the start of my journey to become what I want to be. I was always kind of interested in coding and how computers work when I was a teenager but I couldn't really be bothered     to    research or learn anything about it until I was in my early twenties.<br> This is the first day, on the 28. of June 2018 where I started with The Odin Project to get myself started. 
                I didn't really think that it was that hard just to get started, but you can get pretty overwhelmed by the amount of ressources there are.<br> The Odin Project does a really good job in organising and linking to other sources that explain everything from the ground up, it's a little bit like taking an online class (even though I never actually took an online class, but I imagine that's what it looks like).
                Where this path will lead me? I don't know, but I'm eager to find out.
